## Sigh... Another post about creatine.

Yes, you read that right. Another post about creatine. Join me as I start a loading phase with creatine to get my levels up in a short window of time. I will cover the amounts I do and a day-by-day breakdown of how it's affecting me. Below are some links I found helpful when writing this article.

## My Reasons for taking creatine

So, I'm starting a lifting cycle alongside my CrossFit training to try and build some muscle mass. The most simple reason for using creatine can be taken straight from a quick google. "Creatine is thought to improve strength, increase lean muscle mass, and help the muscles recover more quickly during exercise.", thats pretty much my reason.

Loading creatine is not necessary, I just fancy trying something different and logging the results. When taking creatine I usually go for 3g a day and in time that will be more than enough in your system, from sources I have seen in a month that would be the same amount in your system as I am going to try and load in a 5-day window. Loading is just a shortcut to getting it into your system and being used.

I hypothesise that if I take creatine I should see an increase in muscle mass when loading creatine and doing my daily workout routine, combine with a (relatively) balanced diet and most importantly not forgetting to up my daily water intake to a minimum of 4 litres. This is only a five-day plan so I will leave out the dates and log it day by day and share the results. Enjoy.

## Sunday

Sunday is my rest day, but a good day to start the creatine loading. I'm starting at 10g in the morning and 10g in the evening. From the sources I have read it's a very high amount to take in (but perfectly safe to do so). If it doesn't feel right I can always change the dosage.

**Weigh in:**

- Weight: 87.9kg
- Fat: 11.3%
- Muscle Mass: 84.6%
- Water: 59.7%

## Monday

Shits and stomach cramps. One of the side effects of a high creatine load. Great way to start the day. Honestly, I didn't expect to have this. Just to be certain I'm keeping my daily dose at 20g but now splitting that across 4 5g doses rather than 2 10g doses to see if that fixes it. I'm also taking a rest day today to shake it off.

**Weigh in:**

- Weight: 87.4kg - down 0.4kg
- Fat: 12% - up 0.7%
- Muscle Mass: 84% - down 0.6%
- Water: 59% - down 0.7%

## Tuesday

Towards the back end of Monday, the shits and stomach cramp subsided and this morning I feel much better. As a result I will keep it at four doses of 5g for the remainder of the loading phase. Today is the first day doing exercise since starting the load, I did a heavy high rep squat session. I'm not sure if it's the loading or taking a couple of days off but it was a shocking session. I struggled to lift weights that I know I am more than capable of shifting. For now, I will put it down to the off stomach from yesterday.

**Weigh in:**

- Weight: 87.5kg - up 0.1kg
- Fat: 12% - up 0.7%
- Muscle Mass: 84.3% - up 0.3%
- Water: 59.1% - up 0.1%

## Wednesday

Today I woke up feeling good and went for a heavy deadlift session which went well. I managed to finish with some energy still in the tank. I have no stomach problems anymore, splitting the dosages seem to be playing fine with me.

**Weigh in:**

- Weight: 87.7kg - up 0.2kg
- Fat: 11.7% - down 0.3%
- Muscle Mass: 84.7% - up 0.4%
- Water: 59.5% - up 0.4%

## Thursday

Pretty standard day today. Hit the gym and got my four 5g doses in. I noticed I feel more pumped after the sessions but this has surely got to be placebo.

**Weigh in:**

- Weight: 88kg - up 0.3kg
- Fat: 11.5% - down 0.2%
- Muscle Mass: 85% - up 0.3%
- Water: 60% - up 0.5%

## Friday

Final day and weigh-in. Another pretty avergae day yet again. Gym session and my daily doses. Felt no different to a typical day and the loading phase hascome to an end.

**Weigh in:**

- Weight: 88.5kg - up 0.5kg
- Fat: 11.2% - down 0.3%
- Muscle Mass: 85.2% - up 0.2%
- Water: 60.3% - up 0.3%

## RESULTS

### Weight: 87.9kg -> 88.5 = Increase of 0.6kg

I was expecting the weight to increase with the fact that creatine will make you retain more water weight so this made perfect sense.

### Fat: 11.3% -> 11.2% = Decrease of 0.1%

This is naturally expected with deviation being so small, if this was a larger increase or decrease in a short period this would have been worth breaking down but it is expected to go up and down slightly on a day-by-day basis.

### Muscle Mass: 84.6% -> 85.2% = Increase of 0.7%

Surprising increase. I expected an increase. Only an ever so slight one with me not changing my training much but this change in 5 days was unexpected. It could be to do with the creatine but I cannot truly say. Interpret this how you would like.

### Water: 59% -> 60.3% = Increase of 1.3%

The obvious one. Creatine locks water into your muscles. So this was expected to go up. It probably would have gone up even more if I didn't have the shits for the first day and a half because of my dosage.

## What Now?

Now I have finished my loading cycle my body will have a good base amount of creatine it can access so I will not need to continue taking it in such a large quantity and just maintain the levels. I will reduce my intake to 3g a day taken in one dose for the remainder of my lifting cycle, around 5 or 6 weeks.

## Key Takeaways

- Don't hit more than 5g in one sitting. or be near a toilet for the results. Everyone's body handles this differently so it might be fine for you but if you can there's no harm in splitting it up across the day to not even risk it.
- YOU DON'T NEED TO LOAD. it's just a shortcut if you have the time just maintain a low dosage. I only loaded because I wanted my levels up for the start of a fresh lifting cycle.
- Some people, in very rare cases, are actually creatine resistant so you won't see or feel a difference. Hopefully not but keep it in mind.
- It's super safe. it's of the most researched supplements going (besides protein) and yields real results unlike a lot of the other "miracle" shite you see online... I'm looking at you Ashwagandha
