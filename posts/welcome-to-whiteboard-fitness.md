Welcome to Whiteboard Fitness. The aim of this blog is to review, blog and chat about anything fitness related! This post is simply to say Hi and thanks for checking out the site at this early stage. There's still lots going on and pages will be changing regularly so keep an eye out on things! The headline image picture has absolutely no context for this blog post I just wanted to put a picture of my throwing weight around.

## What can you expect

Although Whiteboard Fitness is new we have a lot of plans underway. Below are some of the things you can expect in the short term, but theres some **_secret things_** in development too

- [Blogs](/blog). Check out the blog page where we are constatnly adding content.
- [Tools](/tools). We will be building fitness tools to help you out in the gym.
- [Workouts](/workouts). Regular WOD's and Workouts for you to try at your gym

## Mission

The primary aim of whiteboard fitness is to deliver quality content that is realistic and honest. The fitness industry whilst mostly amazing is currently in a bad place. Everywhere oyu look theres articles telling you what to do and what to not do, then you look on another site and it tells you the opposite! To counter that Whiteboard Fitness will be honest and show you the results regardless of if they are good or bad and you can decide for yourself with the data if it is something you want to do!

Check out the [about page](/about) for information on the above!

## Thanks

Whilst currently I am a solo developer who is interested in fitness writing this blog and building these tools expect more in the future as I get guest writers to drop articles on the website from time to time!
